# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
Start the program.
### Step 2: 
Initialize the matrix in the form of nested list.
### Step 3: 
Find and print the inverse of the given matrix using numpy.
### Step 4: 
End the program.
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: SETHUKKARASI C
#RegisterNumber:23012881
import numpy as n
a=[[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]]
print(n.linalg.inv(a))
```
## Output:
![inverse_output](https://github.com/SETHUKKARASI3006/INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX/assets/144979338/9a84246e-3d56-4983-9cc7-9939784331fa)
## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
